migrate and loss of which would change migration routes.</p>

			<p><span class="subtitle">CONCENTRATION AREA:</span> That part of the overall range where densities are at least 200%
greater than the surrounding area.

			<p><span class="subtitle">SUMMER RANGE:</span> That part of the home range of a species where 90 percent of the individuals are located during summer. This range may overlap winter range areas in some instances. Summer range will include what has traditionally been known as spring and fall transitional
ranges.</p>

			<p><span class="subtitle">WINTER RANGE:</span> That part of the overall range of a species where 90 percent of the individuals

			<p>SAM data is field based institutional knowledge capture of wildlife distribution in Colorado. Data is gathered via interactive mapping sessions with CPW Wildlife Managers and Biologists typically between scales of 1:24,000 and 1:100,000. To maintain statewide consistency, CPW staff use these definitions to guide their mapping.</p>

			<p>Every year staff from the GIS Unit travels to each Area office in one of four CPW Regions.  The Regional updates occur in a counter clockwise manner.  In other words, one quarter of the statewide data is updated every year with the oldest updates never more than 4 years out of date.</p>

			<p>The SE Region will be mapped in 2025, the NE Region in 2026, the NW Region in 2027, the SW Region in 2028, etc..</p>
