			<p><span class="subtitle">MIGRATION PATTERN:</span> A subjective indication of the general direction of the seasonal
movements of pronghorn antelope.</p>

			<p><span class="subtitle">MIGRATION CORRIDOR:</span> A specific mappable site through which large numbers of animals
migrate and the loss of which would change migration routes.</p>

			<p><span class="subtitle">WINTER CONCENTRATION AREA:</span> That part of the winter range where animal densities are at
least 200% greater than the surrounding winter range density during the same period used to
define winter range in the average five winters out of ten.</p>

			<p><span class="subtitle">WINTER RANGE:</span> That part of the overall range where 90 percent of the individuals are located
between the first heavy snowfall and spring green-up during the average five winters out of ten
OR for a site specific period defined by CPW personnel for that DAU. Winter range is only
delineated for migratory populations. On the Eastern Plains winter range is defined as specific
areas where pronghorn are known to migrate to on a consistent basis.</p>

			<p><span class="subtitle">OVERALL RANGE:</span> The area which encompasses all known seasonal activity areas within the
observed range of a population of pronghorn antelope.</p>

			<p>SAM data is field based institutional knowledge capture of wildlife distribution in Colorado. Data is gathered via interactive mapping sessions with CPW Wildlife Managers and Biologists typically between scales of 1:24,000 and 1:100,000. To maintain statewide consistency, CPW staff use these definitions to guide their mapping.</p>

			<p>Every year staff from the GIS Unit travels to each Area office in one of four CPW Regions.  The Regional updates occur in a counter clockwise manner.  In other words, one quarter of the statewide data is updated every year with the oldest updates never more than 4 years out of date.</p>

			<p>The SE Region will be mapped in 2025, the NE Region in 2026, the NW Region in 2027, the SW Region in 2028, etc..</p>
