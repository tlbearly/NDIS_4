			<p><span class="subtitle">CPW Public Access Properties:</span> The purpose of this CPW dataset is to show Colorado Parks and Wildlife property boundaries managed for use by the public. This dataset is created from property deeds and should not be considered survey quality data.</p>

			<p><span class="subtitle">GMU boundary:</span> Colorado is divided into hunting areas called Game Management Units (GMU). Some licenses are valid in one unit only, while others are valid in multiple units. This CPW dataset tracks and maps the most up-to-date GMU bounaries as defined in <a target="_blank" href="https://cpw.state.co.us/rules-and-regulations">Chapter W-00 - General Provisions</a>. Refer to the Colorado Big Game Hunting Brochure for details: <a target="_blank" href="https://cpw.state.co.us/hunting/big-game">https://cpw.state.co.us/hunting/big-game</a></p>

			<p><span class="subtitle"><a target="_blank" href="https://comap.cnhp.colostate.edu/about-comap/">Land Management (COMAP)</a>:</span> The <a target="_blank" href="https://cnhp.colostate.edu/">Colorado Natural Heritage Program (CNHP)</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="https://gis.colostate.edu/">Geospatial Centroid</a> at Colorado State University (CSU) are the current stewards of COMaP.  COMaP is the state’s premier map of protected lands, featuring over 28,000 entries of protected lands parcels from over 300 different data sources.</p>

			<p><span class="subtitle">CPW Walk In Access:</span> The purpose of this CPW datset is to provide boundaries for private land enrolled in the small game <a target="_blank" href="https://cpw.state.co.us/hunting/walk-access-program">Walk-in Access program (WIA)</a>.  The fields depicted are intended for general reference and do not necessarily depict property boundaries. Field conditions can change often. Hunters should pay attention to the signs posted in the field. They are the deciding factor that determines access as enrolled properties. If a field is posted with a closed sign, there is no hunting allowed in that field, despite what the data depicts.</p>
				
			<p><span class="subtitle">Township Range Sections:</span> In the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) of the United States, a township, range, and section are units of land measurement. A Township is a horizontal row of sections in the PLSS and a Range is a vertical column. Each Township and Range consists of a 6-mile by 6-mile square of land. A Section is a square tract of land that is approximately one mile by one mile and contains 640 acres.  Sections are numbered consecutively from 1 to 36, starting in the northeast corner </p>
