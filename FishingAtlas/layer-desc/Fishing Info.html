			<p><span class="subtitle">Accessible Fishing Area:</span> Places that have a handicap accessible fishing pier.</p>

			<p><span class="subtitle">Fishing Information Point:</span> These points represent our super-set of CPW identified and reviewed fishing opportunities. Clicking any of these points using the Identify Tool will provide you with a host of detailed information. Please note this does not represent every fishing spot in the entire state.</p>

			<p><span class="subtitle">Boat Ramp:</span> Known public boat ramps.</p>
				
			<p><span class="subtitle">Special Fishing Regulations:</span> Those waters that are governed by Special Fishing Regulations as listed in Chapter W-01 of the Wildlife Regulations. Some Property specific regulations have not been mapped, but can be found in Chapter W-09. For all regulations please consult the <a target="_blank" href="https://cpw.state.co.us/rules-and-regulations">CPW Regulations Page</a>. </p>
			
			<p><span class="subtitle">Gold Medal Water:</span>  High quality aquatic habitats that offer the opportunity for trophy trout fishing and angling success. Specifically, any river segment or standing water which is producing a standing stock of at least 60 lbs. per acre and at least 12 trout 14 inches or longer per acre on a sustained basis.</p>
										
			<p><span class="subtitle">Stream Guage:</span> Stream gauge observations of stage height and discharge contributed by the global GIS community and <a target="_blank" href="https://cpw.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=81c5a9f2a2704d54a49042a44eefa5d3">hosted by ESRI</a>.The Live Stream Gauges layer contains near real-time measurements of water depth from multiple reporting agencies recording at sensors across the world. This layer updates every hour. Flow forecasts are provided where available. For details on the coverage in this map and to find out how to contribute your organization's gauges, please email environment@esri.com.</p>
			
			<p><span class="subtitle">Watercraft Inspection Stations:</span> <a target="_blank" href="https://cpw.state.co.us/aquatic-nuisance-species-program">Aquatic Nuisance Species (ANS)</a> are aquatic plants and animals that invade lakes, reservoirs, rivers and streams. â€‹Colorado Parks and Wildlife has built up an extensive network of boat inspection and decontamination stations that are operated collaboratively by state, local, federal and private entities.

			<p><span class="subtitle">Family Friendly:</span> The "Family Fishing" designation is assigned to those places with 1) easy access*, 2) typically an available restroom and 3) a better-than-average chance of catching a fish. * Easy access is defined as a <= 100 yard walk on a gentle slope with a hard surface.</p>

			<p><span class="subtitle">More remote fly fishing:</span> This is the result of asking our Aquatic Biologists to provide a handful of low order trout streams that would provide a "rustic" fishing experience (ie. walk-in, out of the way, fly fishing, high mountain, etc.) for each of the following trout species: Brown, Brook, Cutthroat and Rainbow.</p>

			<p><span class="subtitle">Ice Fishing:</span> Those places typically suitable for ice fishing. Keep in mind that seasonal conditions vary.</p>
			
			<p><span class="subtitle">Stocked with 10'' catchables:</span> These waters have been stocked by CPW with catchable fish three out of the last three years.</p>
