        which would change migration routes.<br><br>
        <b>WINTER CONCENTRATION AREA:</b> That part of the winter range where densities are at least 200% greater than
        the surrounding winter range density during the same period used to define winter range in the average five
        winters out of ten.<br><br>
        <b>WINTER RANGE:</b> That part of the overall range where 90 percent of the individuals are located during the
        average five winters out of ten from the first heavy snowfall to spring green-up, or during a site specific
        period of winter as defined for each DAU.<br><br>
        <b>SUMMER RANGE:</b> That part of the overall range where 90% of the individuals are located between spring
        green-up and the first heavy snowfall. Summer range is not necessarily exclusive of winter range; in some areas
        winter range and summer range may overlap.<br><br>
        <b>RESIDENT POPULATION AREA:</b> An area that provides year-round range for a population of mule deer. The
