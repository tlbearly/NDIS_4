			<p><strong>MIGRATION PATTERN:</strong> A subjective indication of the general direction of the movements of
				migratory ungulate herds.</p>

			<p><strong>MIGRATION CORRIDOR:</strong> A specific mappable site through which large numbers of animals
				migrate and
				loss of which would change migration routes.</p>

			<p><strong>WINTER CONCENTRATION AREA:</strong> That part of the winter range of a species where densities
				are at
				least 200% greater than the surrounding winter range density during the same period used to define
				winter range
				in the average five winters out of ten.</p>

			<p><strong>RANGE:</strong> That part of the overall range of a species where 90 percent of the individuals
				are
				located during the average five winters out of ten from the first heavy snowfall to spring green-up, or
				during a
				site specific period of winter as defined for each DAU.</p>

			<p><strong>SUMMER RANGE:</strong> That part of the range of a species where 90% of the individuals are
				located
				between spring green-up and the first heavy snowfall, or during a site specific period of summer as
				defined for
				each DAU. Summer range is not necessarily exclusive of winter range; in some areas winter range and
				summer range
				may overlap.</p>

			<p><strong>SUMMER CONCENTRATION:</strong> Those areas where elk concentrate from mid-June through
				mid-August. High
				quality forage, security, and lack of disturbance are characteristics of these areas to meet the high
				energy
				demands of lactation, calf rearing, antler growth, and general preparation for the rigors of fall and
				winter.
			</p>

			<p><strong>RESIDENT POPULATION AREA:</strong> An area used year-round by a population of elk. Individuals
				could be
				found in any part of the area at any time of the year; the area cannot be subdivided into seasonal
				ranges. It is
				most likely included within the overall range of the larger population.</p>

			<p><strong>OVERALL RANGE:</strong> The area which encompasses all known seasonal activity areas within the
				observed
				range of an elk population.</p>
