		<div class="content">
			<p><span class="subtitle">MIGRATION PATTERN:</span> A subjective indication of the general direction of the movements of
migratory ungulate herds.</p>

			<p><span class="subtitle">MIGRATION CORRIDOR:</span> A specific mappable site through which large numbers of animals
migrate and loss of which would change migration routes.</p>

			<p><span class="subtitle">WINTER CONCENTRATION AREA:</span> That part of the winter range of elk where densities are at
least 200% greater than the surrounding winter range density during the average five winters out
of ten from the first heavy snowfall to spring green-up, or during a site specific period of winter
as defined for each Data Analysis Unit.</p>

			<p><span class="subtitle">WINTER RANGE:</span> That part of the overall range of a species where 90 percent of the individuals
are located during the average five winters out of ten from the first heavy snowfall to spring
green-up, or during a site specific period of winter as defined for each DAU. Winter range is not
delineated for elk on the Eastern Plains.</p>

			<p><span class="subtitle">SUMMER CONCENTRATION:</span> Those areas where elk concentrate from mid-June through
mid-August. High quality forage, security, and lack of disturbance are characteristics of these
areas to meet the high energy demands of lactation, calf rearing, antler growth, and general
preparation for the rigors of fall and winter.
			</p>
						<p><span class="subtitle">SUMMER RANGE:</span> That part of the range of a species where 90% of the individuals are located
between spring green-up and the first heavy snowfall, or during a site specific period of summer
as defined for each DAU. Summer range is not necessarily exclusive of winter range; in some
areas winter range and summer range may overlap.</p>

			<p><span class="subtitle">RESIDENT POPULATION AREA:</span> An area used year-round by a population of elk. Individuals
could be found in any part of the area at any time of the year; the area cannot be subdivided
into seasonal ranges. It is most likely included within the overall range of the larger population.</p>

			<p><span class="subtitle">OVERALL RANGE:</span> The area which encompasses all known seasonal activity areas within the
observed range of an elk population.</p>

			<p>SAM data is field based institutional knowledge capture of wildlife distribution in Colorado. Data is gathered via interactive mapping sessions 			with CPW Wildlife Managers and Biologists typically between scales of 1:24,000 and 1:100,000. To maintain statewide consistency, CPW staff use these 			definitions to guide their mapping.</p>

			<p>Every year staff from the GIS Unit travels to each Area office in one of four CPW Regions.  The Regional updates occur in a counter clockwise 			manner.  In other words, one quarter of the statewide data is updated every year with the oldest updates never more than 4 years out of date.  The SE 			Region will be mapped in 2025, the NE Region in 2026, the NW Region in 2027, the SW Region in 2028, etc..</p>
