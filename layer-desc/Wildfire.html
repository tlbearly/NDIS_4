        <p>CPW Properties: A specific mappable site through which large numbers of animals migrate and loss of which
            would change migration routes.</p>

        <p>WINTER CONCENTRATION AREA: That part of the winter range of a species where densities are at least 200%
            greater than the surrounding winter range density during the same period used to define winter range in the
            average five winters out of ten.</p>

        <p>WINTER RANGE: That part of the overall range of a species where 90 percent of the individuals are located
            during the average five winters out of ten from the first heavy snowfall to spring green-up, or during a
            site specific period of winter as defined for each DAU.</p>

        <p>SUMMER RANGE: That part of the range of a species where 90% of the individuals are located between spring
            green-up and the first heavy snowfall, or during a site specific period of summer as defined for each DAU.
            Summer range is not necessarily exclusive of winter range; in some areas winter range and summer range may
            overlap.</p>

        <p>SUMMER CONCENTRATION: Those areas where elk concentrate from mid-June through mid-August. High quality
            forage, security, and lack of disturbance are characteristics of these areas to meet the high energy demands
            of lactation, calf rearing, antler growth, and general preparation for the rigors of fall and winter.</p>

        <p>RESIDENT POPULATION AREA: An area used year-round by a population of elk. Individuals could be found in any
            part of the area at any time of the year; the area cannot be subdivided into seasonal ranges. It is most
            likely included within the overall range of the larger population.</p>

        <p>OVERALL RANGE: The area which encompasses all known seasonal activity areas within the observed range of an
            elk population.</p>
