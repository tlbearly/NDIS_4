            <p><span class="subtitle">MIGRATION PATTERN:</span> A subjective indication of the general direction of the movements of migratory ungulate herds.</p>

            <p><span class="subtitle">MIGRATION CORRIDOR:</span> A specific mappable site through which large numbers of animals migrate and loss of which would change migration routes.</p>

            <p><span class="subtitle">WINTER CONCENTRATION AREA:</span> That part of the winter range of a species where densities are at least 200% greater than the surrounding winter range density during the same period used to define winter range in the average five winters out of ten.</p>

            <p><span class="subtitle">WINTER RANGE:</span> That part of the overall range of a species where 90 percent of the individuals are located during the average five winters out of ten from the first heavy snowfall to spring green-up, or during a site specific period of winter as defined for each DAU.</p>

            <p><span class="subtitle">SUMMER RANGE:</span> That part of the range of a species where 90% of the individuals are located between spring green-up and the first heavy snowfall, or during a site specific period of summer as defined for each DAU. Summer range is not necessarily exclusive of winter range; in some areas winter range and summer range may overlap.</p>

            <p><span class="subtitle">SUMMER CONCENTRATION:</span> Those areas where elk concentrate from mid-June through mid-August. High quality forage, security, and lack of disturbance are characteristics of these areas to meet the high energy demands of lactation, calf rearing, antler growth, and general preparation for the rigors of fall and winter.</p>

            <p><span class="subtitle">RESIDENT POPULATION AREA:</span> An area used year-round by a population of elk. Individuals could be found in any part of the area at any time of the year; the area cannot be subdivided into seasonal ranges. It is most likely included within the overall range of the larger population.</p>

            <p><span class="subtitle">OVERALL RANGE:</span> The area which encompasses all known seasonal activity areas within the observed range of an elk population.</p>
