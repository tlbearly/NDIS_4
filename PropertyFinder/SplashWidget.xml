		This mapping application is provided to big game hunters as a virtual 
		scouting tool.  Please remember wildlife and conditions on the ground are 
		constantly changing.  There is no substitute for physically scouting your unit.  For
		more detailed or missing information, please contact the Colorado Parks and Wildlife
		at <b>(303)297-1192</b> (M-F 8am-5pm MST).  Information depicted is for reference
		purposes only and is compiled from the best available sources. Reasonable efforts have
		been made to ensure accuracy. The Colorado Parks and Wildlife is not responsible for
		damages that may arise from the use of this mapping application.  Mapped property
		boundaries may or may not reflect actual legal holdings.  Please observe and respect
		all marked boundaries and signs on properties.  CPW suggests that you err on the side
		of caution and avoid entering areas of question.  It is the hunter's responsibility to
		know where private property exists.  Colorado law does NOT require landowners to fence
		or mark property boundaries. US Forest Service roads are actively managed and are not 
		always accurately depicted on the static base maps used in this application.  For the 
		most accurate USFS road access information, please refer to local forest Motor Vehicle
		Use Maps (MVUM).
