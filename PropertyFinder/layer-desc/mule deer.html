		<div class="content">
			<p><span class="subtitle">MIGRATION PATTERN:</span> A subjective indication of the general direction of the movements of
migratory ungulate herds.</p>
			
			<p><span class="subtitle">MIGRATION CORRIDOR:</span> A specific mappable site through which large numbers of animals
migrate and loss of which would change migration routes.</p>
			
			<p><span class="subtitle">WINTER CONCENTRATION AREA:</span> That part of the winter range where densities are at least
200% greater than the surrounding winter range density during the same period used to define
winter range in the average five winters out of ten.</p>
			
			<p><span class="subtitle">WINTER RANGE:</span> That part of the overall range where 90 percent of the individuals are located
during the average five winters out of ten from the first heavy snowfall to spring green-up, or
during a site specific period of winter as defined for each DAU. Winter range is only delineated
for migratory populations. On the Eastern Plains winter range is defined as areas that provide
thermal cover for deer. Examples are riparian areas dominated by trees and shrubs, areas of
pinyon/juniper, topographic cover such as gullies, draws, canyons, shelter belts and CRP fields
that provide adequate cover.</p>
			
			<p><span class="subtitle">SUMMER RANGE:</span> That part of the overall range where 90% of the individuals are located
between spring green-up and the first heavy snowfall. Summer range is not necessarily exclusive of winter range; in some areas winter range and summer range may overlap.</p>

			
			<p><span class="subtitle">OVERALL RANGE:</span> The area which encompasses all known seasonal activity areas within the
observed range of a mule deer population. </p>

			<p>SAM data is field based institutional knowledge capture of wildlife distribution in Colorado. Data is gathered via interactive mapping sessions with CPW Wildlife Managers and Biologists typically between scales of 1:24,000 and 1:100,000. To maintain statewide consistency, CPW staff use these definitions to guide their mapping.</p>

			<p>Every year staff from the GIS Unit travels to each Area office in one of four CPW Regions.  The Regional updates occur in a counter clockwise manner.  In other words, one quarter of the statewide data is updated every year with the oldest updates never more than 4 years out of date.</p>

			<p>The SE Region will be mapped in 2025, the NE Region in 2026, the NW Region in 2027, the SW Region in 2028, etc..</p>
