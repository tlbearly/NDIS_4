			<p><span class="subtitle">Trails:</span> The Colorado Trail System, now titled the Colorado Trail Explorer (COTREX), endeavors to map every trail in the state of Colorado. Currently there are nearly 40,000 miles of trails mapped. Trails come from a variety of sources (USFS, BLM, local parks & recreation departments, local governments). Responsibility for accuracy of the data rests with the source.<BR><BR>These data were last updated on 11/25/2024.</p>

			<p><span class="subtitle">MVUM Roads:</span> The MVUM roads layers are maintained and imported on demand from the USFS EDW_MVUM_02 layer.  This map service shows the specific types of motorized vehicles allowed on the designated routes and their seasons of use. Data used in this map service are designed to be consistent with the MVUM (Motor Vehicle Use Map). The road and trail data are compiled from the GIS Data Dictionary data and Infra tabular data that the U.S. Forest Service administrative units have prepared for the creation of their MVUMs. This data is published and refreshed on a unit by unit basis as needed and approved by the individual units in order to stay in sync and consistent with the published MVUMs. (<a target="_blank" href="https://apps.fs.usda.gov/arcx/rest/services/EDW/EDW_MVUM_02/MapServer">USFS Map Service Source</a>)</p>
			
			<p><span class="subtitle">BLM Roads:</span> The BLM Roads layers are maintained and imported on demand from the BLM BLM_CO_GTLF layer. This data uses the national BLM Ground Transportation Linear Features (GTLF) standard allowing for the capture of data from the Travel Management Plan (TMP) as well as from observed route usage. Additional attributes were added for Colorado specific purposes.

			<p>Note: In the case of a delay loading these layers, the hunting atlas will automatically continue to attempt to connect in regular intervals.</p>
